# 3D-Printed-Glider
A large scale glider can be fully 3D printed and taken apart making travel easy. This glider was inspired by the Glaser-Dirks DG-808 glider. 
It features a 5 foot wing span made all out of LW-PLA and put together using JB weld Plastic Bonder.

## Design 
![Glider](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/022b5082-4e0a-4e20-a961-54aedcc1937a)

The goal of this project was to design a glider that could perform a long range, shallow descent, and slow flight when thrown off the top of a hill. As simple as that sounds on the surface, myriad decisions had to be made regarding all aspects of the gliderâ€™s composition; The size, shape, and material host complex and difficult challenges in the realm of un-powered flight dynamics. Thus, we took to researching gliding-flight type airfoils, and running XFLR5 CFD analyses on each. This analysis was done to extract, experimentally, the coefficients of Lift, drag as functions of angle of attack, to aid us in our calculations of range, velocity, and flight path angles.

Out of all the airfoil tested our data showed the S1223 airfoil creates the highest lift to drag ratio. Key design elements for the glider other than the airfoil was wingspan, fuselage construction, type of material used and infill percentage. The final glider could possibly achieve a maximum theoretical glide distance of roughly 200ft, demonstrating how stable and high a glide distance is for the glider. 

(This distance does not translate to real life)

## Conclusion

Overall this glider needs to be fine tuned. The glider weighs about 2-3kg and likes to lift a little to fast causing it to do a loop then going stright into the ground. This results in the glider breaking apart like a lego. This project could be a great start for another glider project and the report attached in this readme can show the results of different airfoils and why we landed on this one. The glider was thrown a couple of times and it went about 50 feet each time but the glider kept generating to much lift causing it to stall frequently. This project was incredibly fun for the three of us, and we all feel as if we learned much about aerodynamics, and designing aircraft vehicles.
